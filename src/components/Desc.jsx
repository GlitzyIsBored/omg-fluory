        Heya!! This website is the third rewrite of my main web. This time its
        now written in ReactJS completely from scratch since my previous website
        kept bothering me. I'm a 19 year old girl who's really into web dev. I
        wrote this web since i was inspired by those Carrd profiles and decided
        why not make my own! I cannot really say much other than i am
        chronically sleepy and spend most of my day doing literally nothing. I
        play games and sometimes draw and mostly develop some random projects.
        I'm a wannabe game dev who specialises in front-end web dev and learning
        backend. Tbh idk what i am doing with my life btw i love coffe
