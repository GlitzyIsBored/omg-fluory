        Heya! This website was entirely written in HTML, CSS and JS by some
        tired 19 year old girl and who only functions through coffee. I've
        created this website since I was inspired by those Carrd profiles and
        decided to make my own! My hobby merely consists of me programming,
        building websites, drawing or gaming... there isn't much to say about
        myself other than my personality revolving around programming and most
        of the video game series I am into. I literally spend most of my time
        contemplating life (jk). A little about me is that I am a wannabe game
        dev and a web dev hobbyist but I am leaning more into full stack web
        development. Tbh idk what im doing with my life by the way i lov coffe.
      </p>
